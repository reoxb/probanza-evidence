Recompute every number in the Probanza validation dossier, from the labeled data.

The dossier asks you not to trust it. This is how you don't: this script reads
the hand-labeled CSVs in this repository and prints the precision and recall
table from scratch. If its output disagrees with the published page, the page is
wrong.

No dependencies. Python 3.8+.
